## Decription
The Person Re-Identification Annotator Capstone Project is a web based application built with an angular front-end, and python backend.Tempo Analytics' machine learning algorithm detects and tracks customers entering businesses through multiple cameras and stores these images in tracklet folders. The application assists the annotator to both visualize the results, and fix any errors in the output of the re-identification algorithm, with these changes being reflected in a Ubuntu filesystem. This application is designed to assist a human annotator in sorting, filtering, and all around organizing the customer detection images in an easy to use, user friendly, and intuitive process.
